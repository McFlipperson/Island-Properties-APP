Build comprehensive Proxy-Cheap API integration for expert authenticity with proper error handling and monitoring:

1. Proxy-Cheap API Integration:
   - Complete API client with authentication and rate limiting
   - Core functions: create proxy, delete proxy, get status, test connection, usage stats, IP geolocation
   - Philippines-specific endpoint configuration (Manila/Cebu residential IPs)
   - Robust error handling for API failures, timeouts, and invalid responses
   - Store credentials in Replit Secrets: PROXY_CHEAP_API_KEY, PROXY_CHEAP_BASE_URL

2. Expert-Proxy Assignment System:
   - Database schema: proxy_cheap_id, proxy_ip, proxy_port, proxy_location, proxy_credentials_encrypted, assignment_status, created_at, last_health_check
   - Assignment workflow: validate budget → request proxy → verify location → test connection → activate
   - Status management: "unassigned", "requesting", "testing", "active", "failed", "maintenance"
   - Automatic proxy release and cleanup when expert deleted
   - Budget enforcement (reject if >5 proxies or >$6.35/month)

3. Comprehensive Monitoring System:
   - Scheduled health checks every 20 minutes per proxy
   - IP reputation validation (residential vs datacenter detection)
   - Connection speed and reliability metrics
   - Geographic verification (ensure Philippines location accuracy)
   - Usage tracking and bandwidth monitoring
   - Alert system for proxy failures or reputation issues

4. Security & Data Protection:
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for proxy credentials per expert
   - Secure credential storage with expert-specific encryption keys
   - Connection details isolation (no cross-expert credential access)
   - Audit logging for all proxy operations
   - Environment variable validation and secure configuration

5. Cost Management & Optimization:
   - Real-time cost tracking per proxy and total monthly spend
   - Budget alerts at 80% and 100% of $6.35 limit
   - Automatic cost projection and usage forecasting
   - Proxy utilization metrics to optimize assignments
   - Monthly reporting and cost breakdown per expert

6. Integration Foundation:
   - Browser session configuration data export for future automation
   - Expert switching context preparation with proxy details
   - Connection testing utilities for platform access validation
   - Ready for Playwright browser isolation integration

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
- All operations must handle failures gracefully with user feedback
- Budget constraints must be enforced automatically
- Philippines location validation is mandatory for all proxies
- Complete audit trail for debugging and compliance
